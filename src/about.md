I'm a Finnish software developer from Tampere with a passion for games and a dedication to using technology to create emotional experiences for users. As a hardworking individual, I'm never afraid to take on responsibilities, leveraging my strong foundational skills to learn whatever is necessary for the job. I'm proud to hold a Master of Science (Technology) degree from Tampere University of Technology.

Always ready to learn new things, my interests lean towards game/software development, game design, user experiences, software archetypes, and software testing. I bring 11 years of experience in programming with C++, which includes 4 years of professional work.
